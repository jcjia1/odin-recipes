    <p>Most of the time, we don't get very excited over pork chops. Often overdone, they come out dry, sad, and flavorless. Cooking them in an air fryer changes all that. Due to the intense heat circulation that happens, the outside crisps slightly while the inside stays nice and juicy. 20 minutes later—most of it hands-off time—and it's basically instant dinner. Try it once and let us know down below if you've got a winner on your hands.</p>
    <p>Our version gets coated in Parmesan and plenty of spices for the perfect crust, but you can tinker with the formula to find what works for you. Rub it with cajun seasoning or burger seasoning for a slight twist, or go straight for pre-packaged spice mixes like Old Bay and Cavender's Greek Seasoning.</p>
    <p>One thing to note here is the cooking time: it totally depends on the size of your pork chops. For our recipe, we used boneless pieces about 1" thick. If you're opting for bone-in, that will take longer; if your pork chops are thicker, you will need to increase the cooking time.</p>
    <p>To adhere to the USDA guideline for food safety, pork should be cooked to an internal temperature of 145°. If you're a frequent carnivore, we highly recommend investing in a good cooking thermometer so that you can be sure your chops are fully cooked before digging in!</p>
